Once the prerequisites are met, an access  request can be submitted for the user requiring access. After the request is approved by their manager, a  production user account is automatically provisioned by the identity lifecycle management tool. There are  two types of production access: Application Access (including access to AWS Console) and Host Access. Public cloud environments are created with a set of predefined Salesforce Security approved Identity  Access Management (IAM) roles, which are configured via the public cloud provider’s API."

Salesforce Services on Hyperforce | 35  •  The fourth layer is elevated access (sudo) authentication within the individual production hosts  which requires the user to request elevation via a JIT dashboard. A user must be assigned a  specific role to possess the ability to obtain privileged access at the host level. Access Reviews  On a quarterly basis, management performs an access review of the users with the ability to grant JIT  access, and the related administrators group, in the Salesforce Services on Hyperforce Covered Services  production environment through the public cloud management console and grant JIT elevation (sudo)  access at the host level."
"These are tracked within an internal ticketing system and verifies that terminated  users have been removed from the respective systems and the access rights remain appropriate based on  job functions. Deviations and necessary changes identified during the review are recorded and remediated. In the event terminated users with the ability to grant JIT access or members of the related administrators  group are present at the time of the review, a lookback analysis is performed to help ensure these users  did not improperly use those privileges. Additionally, on an ongoing basis employee transfers are reviewed to determine that access to the  production system is still appropriate. The review is initiated automatically following a change in the HR  system to an employee’s manager combined with additional change in an employee’s job profile, company,  cost center or business unit."
"The change triggers the automatic creation of a transfer review ticket, which  has a defined workflow that requires the user’s manager to review the transferred user’s access for  appropriateness. The manager has 30 days to complete the transfer review and close the ticket and access  not reviewed within 30 days is revoked. If a change in user access is necessary a child ticket is created for  each access to track the removal. Automated workflows are in place to enforce the access removals in  alignment with Salesforce Security Standards. The automated workflows aforementioned do not extend to  the users with the ability to grant JIT access through the public cloud management console and grant JIT  elevation (sudo) access at the host level.

The Hyperforce Infrastructure  Engineering team has created configuration templates for services to utilize in order to securely configure  their AWS resources to encrypt Customer Data at-rest, which includes configuring the Salesforce managed  Customer Managed Key (CMK) for annual rotations. EBS volumes are automatically encrypted by default  at the account level."
"Policies are in place to help ensure encryption is enabled and will block any resources  from being created or modified if encryption requirements are not met. At-rest encryption of EBS volumes  and S3 buckets is enabled with the Salesforce Managed key. The Hyperforce Infrastructure Engineering  team utilizes Salesforce managed-CMKs to encrypt each EBS volume and S3 bucket. Encryption keys are  fully managed by AWS and are not visible to customers. As part of its management, AWS handles rotation  of CMKs via AWS Key Management Service (KMS), as configured by the Hyperforce Infrastructure  Engineering team. Change Management  The change management process supports a controlled framework as well as proper segregation of duties  for the approval and implementation of changes. Salesforce’s Change Management Standard outlines the  activities to be performed during each phase of the change process, as applicable, and the supporting tasks  that need to be completed for each activity."
"Salesforce Services on Hyperforce | 39  To manage the change process, a change control system is used as the ticketing and tracking tool for the  changes. The Covered Services uses industry recognized code versioning software for source control  management and making changes to its repositories via pull requests. The change control system requires  multiple criteria to be completed before a change can be pushed to production, including a link to the pull  request, automated or manual tests, and approvals as defined for given change types. Testing includes two  areas: change readiness testing and post-deployment verification testing. Change readiness testing  determines whether a change case meets the expected requirements and can include unit, functional,  scenario, stress, performance, and/or security testing. Post-deployment verification testing verifies that the  change is successful through automated deployment testing."
"A change request is considered complete  when the required fields are filled, and approvals are met. Infrastructure Change Management  The change management process is a defined process that requires people, process, and technology to  support the process. Changes to infrastructure components in public cloud environments are made through  code utilizing industry standard Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software. Individuals who wish to deploy an  IaC change into production are required to follow the defined Global Change Management Procedure and  Change Management Security Standard, and to complete mandatory change management training before  participating in the change management process. The Global Change Management Procedure defines the  required approvals that a change must route through before the change owner can begin the change in  production."
"Salesforce uses a ticketing system as the technology to support the change management  process as defined in the Global Change Management Procedure. Infrastructure change management encompasses operational changes for maintaining the service at the  network and database level. The majority of changes that are processed via the Salesforce infrastructure  change process are Standard or Standard Pre-Approved changes. These changes are considered lower  risk, routine operating activities and either follow an established pre-approved template or require a peer  review approval; and are systematically implemented based on an approved change category prior to  implementation. There are five change types: Standard Pre-Approved, Standard, Minor, Significant, and Emergency Break  Fix. Standard Pre-Approved changes are structured for repeatable execution."
"Standard Pre-Approved  changes may be automatically implemented when the ticket is created as it follows a standard change  template, which has been pre-approved via the Change Advisory Board (CAB). These are limited to low- risk changes and typically include patching or other operational activities and have a consistent history of  success and execution without errors. Standard changes are low-risk, performed frequently, use a defined  template or run list, and require peer approval. Minor changes are deemed low to moderate risk. Significant  changes are higher risk changes. Minor and Significant change types require peer approval and review  from specific individuals in the related functional approval group and/or Change Management team and  can be subject to a CAB review before approval. Emergency Break Fix changes are unplanned changes  often in response to an event and require peer review and Executive approval."
"A pipeline will not deploy  without an approved scheduled change case or a Standard Pre-Approved change template, which allows  the pipeline to generate a case. Application Change Management  Application change requests are documented and tracked through the online ticket management system  and code repository. Desired application functionality and features are identified, prioritized, and initiated  by product owners for future development. Information security, availability, and confidentiality    Salesforce Services on Hyperforce | 40  considerations are core components in application development and testing. Adaptive Development  Methodology (ADM) and Scrum project management frameworks are used to manage application  development and testing.
