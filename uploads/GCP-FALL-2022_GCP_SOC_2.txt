For 1 of the 25 samples selected, 
the Code of Conduct was not 
acknowledged in a timely manner 
following the employee's hire date. 
Additionally, relevant HR Operations 
personnel were not notified of the 
unactioned Code of Conduct due to 
technical system errors. We 
selected an additional 13 samples 
and determined that the Code of 
Conduct was acknowledged in a 
timely manner for all 13 samples.  
 
Management's Response:  
 
Management acknowledges the 
delay in signing the Code of 
Conduct by sampled personnel was 
caused by a previously unidentified 
system error in the onboarding 
tracking system. Management 
performed an impact analysis to 
determine that approximately 0.1% 
of Google employees and interns 
onboarded during the audit period 
were impacted by the system error. 
Management has remediated the 
system error and completed the 
signing of the Code of Conduct 
acknowledgement for affected 
personnel.
