System-generated population listings were obtained whenever possible to ensure completeness prior to selecting 
samples.  In some instances, full populations were tested in cases including but not limited to, the uniqueness of 
the event or low overall population size. 
 
 
Reliability of Information Provided by the Service Organization 
 
Observation and inspection procedures were performed related to certain system-generated reports, listings, and 
queries to assess the accuracy and completeness (reliability) of the information used in the performance of our 
testing of the controls.  
 
 
Test Results 
 
The results of each test applied are listed alongside each respective test applied within the Testing Matrices.  Test 
results not deemed as control deviations are noted by the phrase “No exceptions noted.” in the test result column 
of the Testing Matrices.  Any phrase other than the aforementioned, constitutes either a test result that is the result 
of non-occurrence, a change in the application of the control activity, or a deficiency in the operating effectiveness 
of the control activity.  Testing deviations identified within the Testing Matrices are not necessarily weaknesses in 
the total system of controls, as this determination can only be made after consideration of controls in place at user 
entities and subservice organizations, if applicable, and other factors.  Control considerations that should be 
implemented by subservice organizations, in order to complement the control activities and achieve the applicable 
trust services criteria, are presented in the “Subservice Organizations” section within Section 3.
