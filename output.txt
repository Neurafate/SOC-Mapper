Google Cloud Platform is designed with the assumption that user entities (also referred to as customers) would implement certain policies, procedures, and controls. In certain situations, the application of specific or additional controls at the user entity may be necessary to achieve the applicable trust criteria stated in the description. Therefore, each user’s controls must be evaluated in conjunction with the controls summarized in Section III and Section IV of this report.

This section describes those additional policies, procedures, and controls that Google recommends user entities should consider to complement Google’s policies, procedures, and controls. Management of the user entity and the user entity’s auditor should consider whether the following controls have been placed in operation at the user entity:
